        <li id="tribute-info"><b>Cats</b> - possess an independent spirit, a quality often associated with perfection. While they form deep and meaningful bonds with their human companions, they retain an aura of self-reliance. They are known to assert their boundaries and exhibit a sense of autonomy, choosing when and how to engage with the world around them.</li>

      <i><p>“Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are God. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are God.”</p>
